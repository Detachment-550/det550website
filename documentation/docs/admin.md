The admin section is where all of the Administrative operations for the website take place. For this reason only users
with administrative privileges will see this page as an option for them in their navigation menu.

# Groups

The groups feature of the website enables the creation of groups of users. This makes sending announcements to specific 
users much more efficient. If an announcement is sent out to a group only members of that group will see the 
announcement.

*Note: Currently if an announcement is posted to a specific group the GroupMe channel will still be notified with every 
one inside.*
