The announcements page is one of the main features of the web application. Here you can post announcements for all 
user's to view. You can also edit any announcement that you have posted (only you have this ability).

# Make an Announcement

To make an announcement navigate to the 'Announcement' page and do the following steps:

1. Click the button 'Make an Announcement' at the top of the page. 
2. Select the groups you would like to send an announcement out to. 
    - *Note: if you would like to select more than one group hold the 'Ctrl' button and click the groups you would like 
    to be notified.*
3. Enter the announcement title.
    - This will be the hyper link at the top of the announcement on the announcements page.
4. Enter the announcement subject.
5. Enter the actual announcement itself into the description section.
6. Click the 'Post Announcement' button.

Your announcement has now been posted to the site. 

*Note: Simultaneously the GroupMe channel titled announcements has been notified as well.*

# Edit an Announcement

To edit an announcement you must be the creator of the announcement. To edit your own announcement do the following:

1. Navigate to the announcements page.
2. Find the announcement you would like to edit and click the hyper linked title.
3. On the announcement page you should (if you are the creator of the announcement) see a button titled 'Edit 
Announcement' on the bottom right of the announcement. Click this button.
4. Once redirected to the edit announcement page edit the announcement as needed. 
5. Click the 'Save Changes' button.

The changes you made to the announcement will be updated.

*Note: This does not re-post the announcement anywhere so you may want to send out a message saying the information was 
updated on the announcement.*

# Read & Understood

This function was developed as a way to give users some system to track who has read the announcement. To mark an 
announcement as 'Read & Understood' do the following:

1. Navigate to the 'Announcements' page.
2. Click the 'Read & Understood' button. 

That's it the system has now recorded that you have read and understood the message. If you would like to verify this 
click on the number next to the 'Read & Understood' button you just clicked. This will redirect you to a page with all 
of the users who have read and understood the message.
