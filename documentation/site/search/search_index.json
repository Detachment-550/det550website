Production Site To manage the cPanel account for the Production site use this cPanel link. Filezilla Devlopment Site To use Filezilla create a new site in the site manager section. You will need to set the following information for the afrotc site connection: Protocol : SFTP Host : ftp . union . rpi . edu Logon Type : Normal User : afrotcdev Password : P - l @ Fe$nq6z - You will also need to have the vpn running a connection to the rpi vpn in order to ssh in to the file system. This can be accomplished by going to the following website https://dotcio.rpi.edu/services/network-remote-access/vpn-connection-and-installation and follow the instructions. Production Site The production's cPanel ssh login information is as follows: Username : g7afzsg72ror Password : F @ lcons550 To log on you must use the server IP address and use SSH protocol: 107 .180.9.193 Windows Development Set Up Local Database Configuration First install MYSQL for windows community edition at the following link: Windows MySQL Installer Run through the installation process and remember what you set your root password to because you will need it later. Go into the project and edit the following file application/config/database.php. In this file fill out the following information according to what you configured in the installation of your version of MYSQL. At this point you will need to change the way the database is configured for authentication. Use the following command with your username and password for the database user who will access the shelterenterprise database TODO Find command. Then copy the schema located in the repository sql/shelterenterprises.sql and run that code under a schema titled shelterenterprise. This will structure your database for the website. Local PHP Configuration Download the latest version of php at the following link: PHP Download Extract the zip folder to a folder where you'd like to store PHP. Go in this folder and find the file titled 'php.ini - development' and create a new document in the same directory called php.ini. This will be the configuration settings file of your local PHP environment. Edit this file and uncomment the following line: extension_dir = ext to allows the computer to find the extensions like mysqli that you will need. 5. You must then find the line: ;extension=mysqli Uncomment it to allow php to use that extension. (To uncomment remove the ';') 6. Now if you were to attempt to run the site you will most likely get the following error: Message: mysqli::real_connect(): The server requested authentication method unknown to the client [caching_sha2_password] To fix this use one of the following sql commands under your schema shelterenterprise: ALTER USER mysqlUsername @ localhost IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY mysqlUsernamePassword ; or if you are creating a user for the database: CREATE USER jeffrey @ localhost IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY password ; To run your locally hosted site run the following in your terminal. Note: you can use any port you wish to that is not already in use. Using port 8040 is not required. If you do choose to use a different port just update the application/config/config.php file accordingly.
